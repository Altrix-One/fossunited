<h3 style="font-size:1.5rem;">Greetings!</h3>

<p>Thank you for taking the time in submitting a proposal to speak at {{ doc.event_name}}.</p>

<p>It was a difficult selection process and if possible we would love to host them all, but unfortunately,
    <b>your talk was not among the ones which made it into the final selection</b>.</p>

<p>Login to the <a href="#" style="font-weight: bold; color: #39C572;">proposal page</a> to view the comments from reviewers.</p>
<p>Keep up the good effort. We hope you will submit proposals for the next meetup as well, while we shall also reach out to you for future meetups.</p>
<p>We still look forward to having you at the meetup to attend talks, network, and share your ideas.</p>

<p>
    Do reply to this email in case of any queries or reach out on <a href="https://t.me/fossunited" style="color: #39C572;">Telegram</a>.
</p>

<p>Thank you once again.</p><br/>

<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>The FOSS United Bangalore Team</p>
