<h3 style="font-size:1.5rem;">Greetings!</h3>

<p>Thank you for taking the time in submitting a proposal to speak at {{ doc.event_name}}. <br/> <br/>
It was a difficult selection process and if possible we would love to host them all, but unfortunately,
<b>your talk was not among the ones which made it into the final selection</b>.<br/> <br/>

Login to the <a href="#" style="font-weight: bold; color: #39C572;">proposal page</a> to view the comments from reviewers.<br/> <br/>
Keep up the good effort. We hope you will submit proposals for the next meetup as well, while we shall also reach out to you for future meetups.<br/> <br/>
We still look forward to having you at the meetup to attend talks, network, and share your ideas.<br/> <br/>

Do reply to this email in case of any queries or reach out on <a href="https://t.me/fossunited" style="color: #39C572;">Telegram</a>.<br/> <br/>

Thank you once again.<br/> <br/>

Regards,<br/><br/>
Team {{ doc.event_name }}</p>
